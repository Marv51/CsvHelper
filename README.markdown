# MiniCsvHelper

This is a fork of [JoshClose/CsvHelper](https://github.com/JoshClose/CsvHelper), but it is not a fork at all.

The goal here is to create a small trimmable subset of the features in CsvHelper that satisfies my needs.

A library for reading and writing CSV files. Extremely fast and easy to use.
